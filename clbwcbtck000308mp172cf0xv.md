# Building  a Telegram  Bot with ZettaBlock GraphQL API

## Intro

Hello everyone, In this blog, I am going to show you how I build a Telegram bot and Integrated it with the **GraphQL API** that I made using **ZettaBlock**. We are going to learn about what is **ZettaBlock** and how we can use it to build our Web2 and Web3 Applications very easily and how it can help in our development process.

So let's learn a little bit about ZettaBlock before starting our bot development process.

## What is ZettaBlock?

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671516673580/CbBFXodlD.png align="center")

Zettablock is a decentralized platform that utilizes blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and scalable solution for data storage and management. It allows users to store and manage data in a decentralized manner, without the need for a central authority or server. Zettablock utilizes a unique GraphQL API, which allows developers to easily build and integrate applications with the platform. The platform also offers robust security measures, including encryption and proof of authenticity, to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of stored data. Overall, Zettablock provides a powerful and flexible solution for managing and storing data in a decentralized manner.

It can be used to index both off-chain and on-chain data with the help of GraphQL API and SQL Queries. ZettaBlock supports the following chains: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Aptos, Solana, Ripple XRP, and IoTex. And more are coming soon.

To learn more about the platform you can visit their website ðŸ‘‰ [Zettablock.com](https://www.zettablock.com/)

## How Zettablock works?

The image shown below will help you understand how it works

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671517311887/fzWLufVM8.png align="center")

**Note**: This image belongs to [Zettablock Developer Docs](https://docs.zettablock.com/docs)

The Zettablock platform is powered by a distributed network of nodes, each of which stores a copy of the data on the platform. When data is added to the platform, it is encrypted and distributed among the nodes in the network. This ensures that the data is secure and cannot be accessed or modified without the proper authorization.

To access or modify the data on the platform, users can utilize the Zettablock GraphQL API. This API allows developers to build and integrate applications with the platform, allowing users to easily store, retrieve, and manipulate data on the platform.

This is just the overview of what is Zettablock and how it works. We will learn more about it during our bot development process, which we are going to start now.

## Prerequisites

You should have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v14 or greater.

You should have a basic understanding of the following:

*   Javascript
    
*   [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
    
*   [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/)
    
*   Nodejs
    

At least you must have an understanding of Javascript to understand it better.

Also, I am going to use typescript just to enable type-checking. But this is optional. I will explain what I am doing with it during the process.

You can visit [Zettablock docs for GraphQL and SQL](https://docs.zettablock.com/docs/i-am-new-to-sql-graphql) Beginners. There they have mentioned some resources where you can learn about both of them and also some basic queries are also there.

## Basic Setup

First, I am going to create a repository named Zettablock and open it in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**.** You can use any IDE of your choice.

Then you need to run the following command to make a ***package.json*** file which will contain the name of our development packages and some important commands.

```bash
npm init
// or 
npm init --y
```

## Installing Dependencies/Packages

Now run the following command to install are necessary packages:

**Using Yarn**

```bash
yarn add dotenv telegraf typescript ts-node @types/node nodemon axios
```

**Using npm**

```bash
npm install dotenv telegraf typescript ts-node @types/node nodemon axios
```

## Getting our Bot token from Telegram

Telegram provides us a way to create a telegram bot easily with the help of the ***BotFather bot.*** You can think of it as a super bot that is provided by telegram that can help you to create new bots and manage your bots.

Just write the username ***BotFather*** telegram search bar and you will find this bot ***ðŸ‘‡***

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671521104736/fEy04wtZE.PNG align="center")

Select the one with â˜‘. That is the original one.

now press the start button and it will show you some commands like ***/newbot***

and ***/mybot.*** Press on the ***/newbot*** which will create the new bot for you.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671521380340/yAQ21EiYa.PNG align="center")

Now it will ask you some questions about the ***name*** of the bot and ***the username*** that you want to assign to it. Just provide those details. I am giving ***ENS\_RESOLVER*** as a name and ***ENS\_RESOLVER\_BOT*** as a username, which i will explain later why I named it this.

After giving those details, you will get your bot token in a message like this

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671521744271/MsIXrKlxX.png align="center")

The shaded region in the image contains your bot token that we are going to use later.

## Starting project

Now create a new file within the same directory with the .ts extension. I am going to create ***bot.ts.*** This file will contain our code for the telegram bot.

Write the following code in the **bot.ts** file:

```typescript
// importing packages
import { Telegraf } from "telegraf";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

// Creating bot object using Telegraf class and passing Bot token as a string
const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN  as string);

// This will be invoked when we write /start command on telegram bot
bot.start((ctx)=>{
    ctx.reply("Welcome to bot");
})

// This wiil be invoked on when we write /help command
bot.help((ctx)=>{
    ctx.reply("This is help command");
})

// this will make our bot ready for the 
bot.launch();
```

In the above code, we are importing packages like `telegraf` and `dotenv` first that we will use in our files.

To create the bot object which will help us to use various commands and functions to interact with user messages, we are using `Telegraf()` constructor and passing it a bot token.

The token is very crucial since it gives access of our bot to anybody. That is why we need to store it somewhere safe where only we can access it. Nodejs provide us with a way to store these types of private values in a ***.env*** file. we can access those variables using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` in our Nodejs scripts.

To create a ***.env*** file just create a file with name ***.env*** and write the following code in it and paste your bot token as a value:

```bash
BOT_TOKEN='Your Bot Token from telegram'
```

The token that is passed to `Telegraf()` constructor should be a string that will give us a typescript error if we pass it like `process.env.BOT_TOKEN`. We need to force it as a string which we can do with `as` keyword and then we will write the type we want to assign it. Hence the argument will look like this `process.env.BOT_TOKEN as string`

We also have to launch our bot first so that users can start interacting with it easily. Which we are doing at the end of the file with `bot.launch()` the method inside the bot object.

`bot.start()` and `bot.help()` are also other two methods of the bot object that will react to the `/start` and `/help` commands of the user. Both of these methods take the arrow function as an argument that contains the context (i.e `ctx`) object as a parameter. This context object will help us interact with the users.

Let's test the bot.

Open your terminal and write the following command:

```bash
npx nodemon bot.ts
```

This will start the server. The [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is a tool that will look for the changes in the file and will restart the server after every change.

Once the server has been started, go to BotFather telegram where you created the bot and press this link on the message

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671523750390/92b8MbwfJ.png align="center")

This will take you to your bot where you can start experimenting with it.

Just write your commands `/start` and `/help` to check if it is working properly or not.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671524014507/k4j7mtIN7.png align="center")

And we can see it is working.

Great! now let's go to ZettaBlock and create the API that we will use with our bot.

## Creating ZettaBlock GraphQL API

**Step 1**: visit this link ðŸ‘‰ [ZettaBlock APP](https://app.zettablock.com) and create an account.

**Step 2**: You will be redirected to this page ðŸ‘‡

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671524322859/oR5aETPLX.png align="center")

Click on the ***create*** button in the top right corner and select the ***query builder*** option which will help to create the query.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671524416235/H9PF5wtcD.png align="center")

you will be redirected to the query builder page shown in the image below.

**Step 3**: Select the database and table you want to create your command with. I am using `ens` database and `ens.ethereum_ens_name_registrations` table of it.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671524701380/xIzaxE3Z_.PNG align="center")

Now why ***ENS?***

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is **a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain**. ENS's job is to map human-readable names like 'Alice. eth' to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata.

That is why I also choose the bot name ENS\_RESOLVER.

**Step 4**: Now write your SQL query in the write section of the page. I am going to write the following query

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671524829836/ZuSd3ga6e.png align="center")

```sql
SELECT
  "transaction_hash",
  "block_number",
  "block_time",
  "contract_address",
  "event",
  "name",
  "label",
  "owner",
  "cost",
  "expires",
  "data_creation_date"
FROM
  ens.ethereum_ens_name_registrations
```

Step 5: Run the command first by pressing the **Run Selected** button in the right bottom corner. It will give you the results After some time. Just wait for the counter to finish.

After finishing, you will get the results like this which means the SQL query we have written is correct.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671525192317/Smi72cIit.png align="center")

**Step 6**: Now press the **Create API Button.** You will be prompted whether you want to create the API with the following query. Just press yes and you will be redirected to another page. Now fill in the various options that have been given to you and you are good to go.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671525434874/DrfahCNEV.png align="center")

Now press on the create API button again in the top right corner. You will be redirected again to the next page.

**Step 7**: Now on this page, you will see some info about your API

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671525816908/KhW6dm9lA.png align="center")

The red arrow in the above image shows your GraphQL URL that you will use to query data with a simple GraphQL Query. The Blue arrow shows a progress bar. It just shows that the latest data is being indexed to show you the latest information.

After this indexing, you can go to the playground option on the right side of the overview tab and you can start playing with your API.

I just ran the following GraphQL query and it fetched me the result.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671526091029/_hY7yEKOr.png align="center")

Now that our GraphQL API is ready, we can start using it with our bot.

But for using it we need our API key and APP ID.

To access the API key press the copy button on the URL shown in the above image

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671526409709/7EXaP6scB.png align="center")

The following prompt will open

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671526481428/Gn7ulCCef.png align="center")

Just press the Manage API key button and you will be redirected to the page where you can copy your API key.

The black shaded area in the above image contains your APP ID.

Copy those two in your `.env` file too.

```bash
BOT_TOKEN="bot token goes here"
ZETTABLOCK_API_KEY="api key"
ZETTABLOCK_APP_ID="app id"
```

## Adding custom command

We have almost everything ready to complete our bot. Now I want to add a custom command as we get `/start` and `/help` . How can we do that with `telegraf` .

Well there is one more method of the Telegraf class which is `command()` , which I can use with my bot object like `bot.command()` .

This method takes two parameters. First is the name of the command as a string and another one is a callback function which is the same as we get in our above mentioned `/start` and `/help` commands.

What I want is I want to give the users to pass the ENS name as input with my custom command like `/ens [name]` and in return, they get output-like details that are related to their ens names.

To do that I am going to create a custom command name `/ens` which will take input from the user and send them their details back. Now I am going to paste here my updated bot.ts file and will try to explain everything. So here is my code

```javascript
import { Telegraf } from "telegraf";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import requestDataFromEns from "./request";

dotenv.config();

const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN  as string);
const helpMessage = `ðŸ“„ Here is a list of useful commands  
    /help - for help
    /start - to start the bot
    /ens  <ENS NAME> - to get the data of ens domain
        (Name should be without .ens)
`;

bot.start((ctx)=>{
    ctx.reply("Welcome to ENS Resolver Bot: " + ctx.message.from.username)
    ctx.reply(helpMessage);
})

bot.command(['ens', "ENS", "Ens", "eNs"],async (ctx)=>{
    const textArray = ctx.message.text.split(" ");
    const command = textArray.shift();
    const ensName = textArray.join(" ") || null;

    if(ensName && textArray.length === 1){
        // to check name doesn't full ens name like aamir.eth
        if(ensName.includes('.')){
            ctx.reply("invalid name");
        }
        const record = await requestDataFromEns(ensName);
        
        // to check if the returned record has value or not
        if(!record?.transaction_hash){
            return ctx.reply("No record with given Ens");
        }
        
        // custom message to send with the recieved record
        const messageToSend =
            `<i>Details For Ens Name:</i> <b>${ensName}</b>\n<b>Name</b> -                          ${record!.name}\n<b>Contract Address</b> - <a href='https://etherscan.io/address/${record.contract_address}'>${record!.contract_address}</a>\n<b>Owner</b> - <a href='https://etherscan.io/address/${record.contract_address}'>${record!.owner}</a>\n<b>Label</b> - ${record!.label}\n<b>event</b> - ${record!.event}\n<b>Cost</b> - ${record!.cost}\n<b>Expires</b> - ${record!.expires}\n<b>Block Number</b> - ${record!.block_number}\n<b>transaction_hash</b> - <a href='https://etherscan.io/tx/${record.transaction_hash}'>${record!.transaction_hash}</a>
            `
        // use ctx.replyWithHTML if you want to use html in you message
        // disable_web_page_preview is true so that we don't get the preview 
        // of our links.
        ctx.replyWithHTML(messageToSend,{disable_web_page_preview: true})
    }else{
        ctx.reply("Invalid Command! Try again");
    }
})

bot.help((ctx)=>{
    ctx.reply(helpMessage);
})

bot.launch();
```

In the above code, I first added the the `helpMessage` that I want to send every time my users ask for help with `/help` . I will also send the same message when user write `/start` for the first time to let them know the all available commands.

Now in `bot.start()`, there is something like this `ctx.message.from.username` that I used to reply to the user. This is just the username of the person who sends the input. In fact `ctx` is a very big object that I cannot paste here, but you can try to console log it. `ctx` contains other useful properties like the details of the message and many more. In this case, we are not going to look at them because our bot doesn't require all those things. But are free to do that.

Here I created a command with `bot.command()` and passed it an array. I added this to make sure that there is no confusion about case sensitivity. Users should be able to write `/ens` or `/ENS` to get the same result. If you want to use only one value, pass the command name as a string only.

I have made some checks that I have mentioned in the code itself. I want you to look at them before going further.

Now there is one more function that I used which is this `requestDataFromEns(ensName)` . This is a custom function that I made to request my GraphQL URL for data. I created this in a separate file. This is the file that contains this function.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
import IEnsAPIResponse from './Interfaces/IENSApiResponse';

export default async function requestDataFromEns(ensName: string): (Promise<IEnsAPIResponse|null>){
    const options = {
        method: 'POST',
        url: `https://api.zettablock.com/api/v1/dataset/${process.env.ZETTABLOCK_APP_ID}/graphql`,
        headers: {accept: 'application/json', 'content-type': 'application/json',"X-API-KEY": process.env.ZETTABLOCK_API_KEY},
        data: { query: `
            {
                record(name:"${ensName}") {
                  name,
                  contract_address,
                  owner,
                  label,
                  event,
                  cost,
                  expires,
                  block_number,
                  transaction_hash
                }
            }
            `
            }
        };

        const data = await axios
        .request(options)
        .then(function (response) {
            return response.data;
        })
        .catch(function (error) {
            console.error(error);
        });

        return data.data.record;
}
```

In this file first I imported an `axios` which I am going to use to make requests. In the file, I also imported the `IEnsAPIResponse` which is an interface that I created just to make sure that my function returns the same output every time.

If you don't know about Interfaces, just think of them as a blueprint that I can add to my variables and objects. This blueprint will tell me what kind of data my variable or object contains. It is just an extra functionality that typescript provides use to ensure type checking and to make our code bug free. This is the Interface that I used ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
export default interface IEnsAPIResponse{
    name: string
    contract_address: string
    owner: string
    label: string
    event: string
    cost: string
    expires: string
    block_number: number
    transaction_hash: string
}
```

By the way, if you are not familiar with `axios` , feel free to use any library or you can even use the built-in javascript API to make calls. I use Axios because it's very handy and also doesn't give some weird bugs that we might get with native javascript.

If you go to this link [ZettaBlock API Reference](https://docs.zettablock.com/reference/post_dataset-id-graphql), you will find more ways to make requests to the dataset.

If we talk about the structure of the `requestDataFromEns` function, It is going to accept to username as `ensName` from the user, which will always be a string and will return the promise that will be in the form of our above-mentioned Interface.

This function contains options that I also copied from [ZettaBlock API Reference](https://docs.zettablock.com/reference/post_dataset-id-graphql). I just added my own `url` that I copied from the ZettaBlock API that we created. And also one more property in the `options.headers` which is `"X-API-KEY"` that will contain my API\_KEY that we created above.

There is also our query like we make above in our ZettaBlock playground.

And everything is almost the same. I just returned the record from the data property of the object.

And this is it. Our Bot is ready. Now we just need to go to the telegram bot and check if everything is working properly.

Here are the results.

For new `/start` and `/help` commands

For `/ens` command:

For the error when the wrong name is passed:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671541407172/ycexb8oyk.PNG align="center")

We just need to deploy it and you are ready to go.  
If you want to access my telegram bot type this username in search bar @ENS\_RESOLVER\_BOT

## Conclusion

And this is how you build a telegram bot that uses ZettaBlock GraphQL API for indexing data.

If we talk about ZettaBlock, I think what they are doing is very amazing. We know as a developer if we want to build an application built on blockchain and also makes use of centralized databases to store the data, we have to create and manage a separate setup for both. This is such a very complex task and requires a lot of maintenance. This is where ZettaBlock comes in and saves us.

Thank you for reading!
