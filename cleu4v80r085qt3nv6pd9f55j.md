## Overview

In this Blog Post, we are going to discuss everything you need to know about the new [ThirdWeb](https://thirdweb.com/) feature that allows the developers to deploy their smart contracts on any EVM chain available in really easy steps without exposing their private keys or API keys.

## Little About ThirdWeb

I am sure most of you are already familiar with what [ThirdWeb](https://thirdweb.com/) is but if you don't know about what it is, you can think of it as your one-stop-shop for web3 development tools, resources, and community - all in one place.

[ThirdWeb](https://thirdweb.com/) is a complete web3 development framework that provides everything you need to connect your apps and games to decentralized networks.

We will learn some of the features provided by it during this blog post as well. But if you are curious to know more about it, I will highly encourage you to visit their site by clicking [here](https://thirdweb.com/) or any of the above links.

## What is the new Feature?

Now with the help of **ThirdWeb,** you can deploy any contract on any EVM chain. There are 700+ chains available there both L2s and L3s. Earlier this used to be around 7 chains. With this, ThirdWeb has become **the first chain-agnostic web3 framework.**

Not only that they have made improvements in their dashboard. Now you can add any contract to **ThirdWebs Dashboard** no matter if it was deployed using **ThirdWeb** or not. These are some of the features that were added:

* SDKs for React, JavaScript, Unity, Python & Go
    
* A decentralized storage service that uploads & pins files to IPFS for you
    
* Plug-and-play UI components for frontend applications
    

If you want to learn more about it go and check out this official blog from **ThirdWeb** ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://blog.thirdweb.com/any-contract-any-evm-chain/)

## Structure of the Article

This blog post is going to be divided into two sections. Both sections will help you to understand what the new feature is. But in one section you will deploy one of the contracts provided to you on [ThirdWeb's Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard). For that you don't need to create any project or do any coding.

In the second section, we will code our own contract and deploy it using ThirdWeb's CLI tool.

## Section 1: Deploying a contract from ThirdWeb's Explore Section

**Step 1:**

Go to the ðŸ‘‰[ThirdWeb's Explore](https://thirdweb.com/explore) Page

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677928560116/293ca8f4-6191-4841-b754-494a7135f4f6.png align="center")

**Step 2:**

Pick any one of the contracts. I am going to pick thisðŸ‘‡ **ERC20 Token** contract

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677928763051/09af4db4-7c2a-47e1-862e-9dca78194a93.png align="center")

**Step 3:**

Click on it and you will be redirected to another page. On this page, you can check various functions, events, and even the source code of the various contracts used to create this Contract. Just scroll a little bit and you will find everything. Now click on the deploy button in the top right corner.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677929014329/1e01ef56-220b-4739-bf21-371246eb49fc.png align="center")

You will get a prompt like this ðŸ‘‡

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677929267571/4a6c05c8-63e4-488e-8f0c-e60cfc60fa84.png align="center")

There you can add details for your ERC20 token like name, symbol etc. make sure the Recipient Address is your wallet address.

**Step 4:**

After filling in those fields, you need to scroll down to the bottom and you will see the deploy button along with the network settings.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677929529256/0838b17a-dee7-4462-bc05-1c539a1243b6.png align="center")

I am going to select **Polygon Mainnet** but you can select anyone of your choice.

If the network of your choice is not present there, click on **configure Networks** button and you will get a prompt like thisðŸ‘‡

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677929707276/6d0e4161-5fa9-4239-8bf7-778353f7b35a.png align="center")

Here you can search for any EVM of your choice. There are almost 700 different EVMs present in it. If you still can't find the network of your choice, click on the **custom tab** just above the search bar and add the details required like chain id, network name etc. and you will find the network.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677929891131/5999c609-52ac-442d-8cab-4fa51d32dbd1.png align="center")

To get the list of **Chain IDs** and other information go to thisðŸ‘‰ link form **ThirdWeb**

You will see hundreds of chain details on this page. Search for the one you require and copy-paste it.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677941057950/82c433b3-5879-476b-bcdc-0786d3a9d6c1.png align="center")

**Step 5:**

Once you have selected the network, press on the deploy and your contract will start to deploy.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677930058921/4dcb90e1-a147-4692-827e-50162f21aa75.png align="center")

If everything goes fine, you will get the **Metamask** popup to confirm the transaction.

Go ahead and confirm it.

**Step 6:**

Once the transaction is completed, you will be prompted with another confirmation to add your contract to your dashboard.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677930244587/5340ab7f-7093-40b8-b7c4-f8ce817d03ed.png align="center")

You can click on the sign button.

Note: For this transaction, you don't need to pay any gas fee. You can check that on your **Metamask** popup screen. **ThirdWeb** will pay it on your behalf. It just needs your confirmation to add your contract to the dashboard and that is why you need to sign another transaction.

Now once you have done it, you will be redirected to your deployed contract on the ThirdWeb dashboard.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677930523243/bbbbb2fc-4ed7-495a-a1a2-e015b6d3e3b7.png align="center")

And this is it. You have deployed the smart contract to the **POLYGON mainnet.**

On this page, you can check for your contract details like Events, Permission and Source code of the contracts.

There is a **code,** you can go to this tab and you will see how you can import your contract using **ThirdWeb SDKs** for different languages.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677930770199/5e785b2a-b709-4962-ae73-7c9719e933ca.png align="center")

Now let's learn how we can deploy our own contract that we will make using the **ThirdWeb CLI** tool.

## Section 2: Deploying our custom contract with code

In this section, we are going to learn about how we can deploy the custom contract using the **ThirdWeb CLI** tool. we are going to code in this section.

### Prerequisites

1. You should have [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v14 or greater installed on your pc.
    

You should know the following:

* Javascript
    
* Nodejs
    
* Solidity
    

Not some advanced level but at least some basic level of knowledge.

There are some things that we will try to understand on the go.

### Creating a simple solidity project

I will try to explain everything so if you already know how to create a simple solidity project go ahead and move to the deploy section.

First, create a folder and open it in your preferred IDE. I am going to use **VS Code** for it.

Now we are not going to do everything on our own. If you have worked with any local solidity project you will know all of the things we have to do for making a project.

We would require a lot of things and configure a lot of things according to our needs if we want to start from scratch. We don't want to do that for a simple solidity project. So we are going to take a shortcut.

And that will be by using **ThirdWeb CLI.**

Open your terminal and run this command:

```bash
npx thirdweb create
```

You will see something like thisðŸ‘‡

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677936319588/6c031c55-5b52-45b0-8d2c-3997b85f4617.png align="center")

Now it asks what type of project we want to create.

We want to create a contract so we will pick **Contract** it. Select it and press enter.

Now it will ask you for some details about the project. Go ahead and give those details. For Example ðŸ‘‡

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677936675920/c71611d8-a984-4e01-a0d0-3b62982353ba.png align="center")

**NOTE:** for the framework, I am using **Hardhat.** If you know about the second one, go ahead and select it. But you need to find a way to deploy using it on your own.

We are creating an NFT for my profile picture ðŸ˜…. I know it is silly but it's for tutorial purposes.

But you are free to create any kind of project.

Now we will have a directory structure like thisðŸ‘‡

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677937043456/e3852d8a-a82d-455a-8753-ff0d864a2f21.png align="center")

You don't need to know about all of it if you are a beginner. Just follow the tutorial and you will be good to go.

### Creating the smart contract

If you did everything according to me, you will get a file named **MyProfile.sol**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";

contract Contract is ERC721Base {

      constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    )
        ERC721Base(
            _name,
            _symbol,
            _royaltyRecipient,
            _royaltyBps
        )
    {}

}
```

If you did something different and didn't get file like this. don't worry, go ahead and create this file in the **contracts** folder.

Now, we will make some changes to this file. The NFT file we got contains a lot of things that we don't need for this purpose. So I am going to change this file to something like this:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract MyProfile is ERC721 {
    string private constant TOKEN_URI = "<YOUR TOKEN URI>";
    constructor() ERC721("<ENTER NFT NAME>", "<ENTER NFT SYMBOL>") {
        _safeMint(msg.sender,0);
    }

    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public pure override returns (string memory) {
        return TOKEN_URI;
    }
}
```

Change the NAME, SYMBOL and TOKEN URI.

If you don't know what TOKEN URI is, just follow the following steps:

1. Go to ðŸ‘‰[Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) and create your account.
    
2. Now you will get a dashboard like thisðŸ‘‡
    
3. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677937919573/19cdaf3f-0e31-44a0-b14a-e7709fa31f51.png align="center")
    
    Now click on the **Add Files** button and select the **FILE** option from it.
    
4. Click on it and select an image of your choice that you want to create an NFT of.
    
5. Now simply click on the **upload** button and it will start uploading on **Pinata.**
    
6. Once you have done it. you will see a file on your dashboard like this. The **CID** that you see here will be different for your file.
    
7. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677938193776/0d473705-34cf-4255-9c21-f815b1439eba.png align="center")
    
    Copy this **CID** and keep it somewhere for now.
    
8. Now we will create **metadata** that will contain the details about the NFT we are creating. You can simply use this oneðŸ‘‡
    
    ```solidity
    {
        "description": "<Give the description about NFT>",
        "image": "ipfs://<PUT YOUR IMAGE PINATA-HASH/CID HERE>",
        "name": "<GIVE A NAME>",
        "attributes": [
        ]
    }
    ```
    
9. Fill in these details and save it with &lt;file Name&gt;.json
    
10. Now we will upload this metadata on PINATA as well.
    
11. Go ahead and do it as we did with Image. Now again copy the CID.
    
12. Make a URL like thisðŸ‘‡
    
    ```solidity
    "ipfs://<YOUR METADATA CID/HASH>";
    ```
    
    and add it to the NFT file.
    

### Compiling and Deploying the Contract

we can simply run this command in the terminal to compile the contracts:

```bash
yarn build
```

you will get result like thisðŸ‘‡

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677939071623/ff489cb9-6cfb-48ea-9746-c5502e1de9be.png align="center")

Now once it is compiled. Go ahead and run this second command to deploy the contract:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This will be the resultðŸ‘‡

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677939226294/c492116c-b127-49ee-93e0-ff1e23f0ec92.png align="center")

As we can see we get this link at the end. Copy the link and open it in your browser.

A page like this will be openedðŸ‘‡

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677939446511/57d1bc26-03ac-4a90-a237-a9ec62f51daf.png align="center")

If you already know about **Hardhat** and doing stuff like compiling the smart contracts and deploying on the chain you might have noticed that we didn't need to give our private key or provide the **RPC URL** or any other configuration details. This is the power of the **ThirdWeb.**

Now you can see something familiar that we have seen already in our previous section. From here we need to follow the same steps as we did in **Step 4** and onwards of **Section 1.**

I am skipping this because everything from here is the same.

After doing everything we will get a dashboard likeðŸ‘‡ which we also got before:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677940261698/a4b1c2ad-0359-40d5-8ec5-5d9061bc3348.png align="center")

And we are done with it as well.

We have successfully deployed the contracts in both code and no code way.

### **My View on New Features:**

I have been using ThirdWeb SDKs for quite some time and I am amazed at how the team is providing amazing tools like this in such a short period. The team has created something truly exceptional. The product is impeccable and exceeds all expectations.

It's clear that a lot of thought, care, and expertise went into every aspect of its design and development.

It's truly amazing and there are no apparent flaws that I can see.
